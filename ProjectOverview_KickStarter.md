# **Kickstarting with _Excel_**

## Overview of Project
 The Vanderbilt University Data Analytics Bootcamp is a online course covering the technical skills needed to analyze and problem solve in a data driven context.  Module 1 of the program specifies how Microsoft Excel can be used to analyze datasets and aid data visualization.
