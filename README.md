# **Vanderbilt University Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 1: Kickstarting with _Excel_**

## Overview of Project
 The Vanderbilt University Data Analytics Bootcamp is a streamline of coursework that exposes students to a broad set of technical applications and data management concepts, strengthening their problem solving skills in data-driven contexts. Module 1 of the program focuses on Microsoft Excel, the use of statistical measures of spread, pivot tables, formulas, conditional formatting, and data visualization with charts, culminating with an analysis of a case study.

## Case Study: KickStarter Campaigns - Revamping Strategies with Analysis 
 Artistic productions face the challenge of budgets and time constraints, moderating the frequency of campaign success (i.e. productions that make it to audiences, consumers, etc.) and increasing the likelihood of failure or cancellation.  This analysis, performed on behalf of our client, Louise, sets out to unearth patterns explaining campaign success and failure, with an emphasis on theater productions (more specifically, plays), assessing what corrective or explanatory feedback can be provided to Louise. Only $2,485 of the goal of $2,885 were met for the fundraiser for her play, **_Fever_**, in the given four week timeframe, leading to campaign failure.
